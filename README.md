AWGN on MATLAB
===========

This repository contains a MATLAB script that generates a white Gaussian noise with a given power spectral density (psd).

The script implements the following steps:

1 - Given the target PSD, the total noise power is computed. 

2 - Given the total power (equal to variance), the time-domain noise is generated

3 - The PSD of this noise is verifies
